Task 1 – RISC-V Environment Setup

In this task, I set up the RISC-V development environment using GitHub Codespaces and verified the setup by compiling and running a reference RISC-V program.

What I did

First, I opened the vsd-riscv2 repository on GitHub and created a Codespace from it.
Once the Codespace started, I explored the repository and found the RISC-V reference program inside the Samples folder.

I then compiled the sample C program using the RISC-V GNU compiler. After successful compilation, I ran the generated executable using the Spike RISC-V simulator.

The program executed without errors, which confirmed that the environment was set up correctly.
