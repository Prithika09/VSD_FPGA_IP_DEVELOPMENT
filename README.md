Task-1: Environment Setup & RISC-V Reference Bring-Up

Task-1 focused on setting up the official GitHub Codespace using the vsd-riscv2 reference repository.
The RISC-V reference program was successfully built and executed in the Codespace environment, confirming toolchain readiness.
VSDFPGA labs were cloned and run using simulation/log-based flows without any FPGA hardware.
No physical FPGA board was used, as Task-1 is limited to environment setup and reference validation only.
